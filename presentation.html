# Agenda

1. What is it?
2. Getting Started
3. Drawing
4. Functions
5. Classes
6. Sprites
7. Example Code

# What is Arcade?

* Easier and more powerful than Pygame
* 2D games
* Built on top of OpenGL and Pyglet

---

# Installing

`pip install arcade`

Requires Python 3.6 or greater.

---
# Opening a Window

```python
import arcade

# Set constants for the screen size
SCREEN_WIDTH = 600
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 600

# Open the window. Set the window title and dimensions (width and height)
arcade.open_window(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, "Drawing Example")

# --- Drawing Code Will Go Here ---

# Keep the window open until the user hits the 'close' button
arcade.run()
```

# Open the window. Set the window title and dimensions (width and height)
arcade.open_window(SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT, "Drawing Example")

# --- Drawing Code Will Go Here ---
# Start the render process. This must be done before any drawing commands.
arcade.start_render()

# --- Drawing Commands Will Go Here ---

# Finish drawing and display the result
arcade.finish_render()

# Keep the window open until the user hits the 'close' button
arcade.run()

# Drawing

```python
# Draw the face
x = 300; y = 300; radius = 200
arcade.draw_circle_filled(x, y, radius, arcade.color.YELLOW)

# Draw the right eye
x = 370; y = 350; radius = 20
arcade.draw_circle_filled(x, y, radius, arcade.color.BLACK)

# Draw the left eye
x = 230; y = 350; radius = 20
arcade.draw_circle_filled(x, y, radius, arcade.color.BLACK)

# Draw the smile
x = 300; y = 280; width = 120; height = 100
start_angle = 190; end_angle = 350
arcade.draw_arc_outline(x, y, width, height, arcade.color.BLACK,
                        start_angle, end_angle, 10)
```

# Drawing With Functions

```python
def draw_pine_tree(x, y):
    """ This function draws a pine tree at the specified location. """

    # Draw the triangle on top of the trunk.
    # We need three x, y points for the triangle.
    arcade.draw_triangle_filled(x + 40, y,       # Point 1
                                x, y - 100,      # Point 2
                                x + 80, y - 100, # Point 3
                                arcade.color.DARK_GREEN)

    # Draw the trunk
    arcade.draw_lrtb_rectangle_filled(x + 30, x + 50, y - 100, y - 140,
                                      arcade.color.DARK_BROWN)
